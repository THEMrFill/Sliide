# Sliide coding test

This is limited as it was limited in time to only 3 hours, so the code has the di, the database, 
the API call to get the data, and the display dialog for adding a new user

It is written in Kotlin, using Koin for dependency injection, Realm for the database and Retrofit
for the API call

Next steps: 
* complete the new user dialog
* make the API call to make the user
* display the user when tapped through
* adding more user calls when at the bottom of the list
* sorting of the users (as downloaded)
* automation tests including mocking the API response
